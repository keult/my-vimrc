# My Vim Custom Configuration

This repository contains my custom Vim configuration that enhances productivity with improved key mappings, visual enhancements, and user-friendly options. The configuration includes a **Catppuccin Macchiato** colorscheme, optimized search, indentation settings, and custom keybindings.

## Features

### Customizations
- **Catppuccin Macchiato Colorscheme**: A beautiful, modern color theme that is easy on the eyes.
- **Improved Backspace Functionality**: Allows backspace over indentation, line breaks, and the start of insert mode.
- **Mouse Support**: Mouse functionality enabled for clicking and moving the cursor (can be toggled off).
- **Smart Indentation**: Auto and smart indentation for programming files.
- **Space as Tabs**: Replaces tabs with spaces (tab size set to 2 spaces).
- **Enhanced Search**:
  - Incremental search like modern editors.
  - Case-insensitive search (unless uppercase letters are used).
  - Search wraps around the buffer.
- **Key Bindings**:
  - `jj`: Exit insert mode quickly.
  - `Ctrl-s`: Save the current buffer.
  - `Ctrl-S`: Save all buffers.
  - `Ctrl-a`: Select all content.
  - `Ctrl-h` and `Ctrl-l`: Move between buffers.
  - `Ctrl-j` and `Ctrl-k`: Join and split lines.
- **Relative Line Numbers**: Easier navigation with relative line numbers.
- **Auto-read**: Automatically reloads a file when changed from the outside.
- **Improved Buffer Management**: Buffers with unsaved changes are hidden instead of being forced to save.
